# basicTCP_server-client
Wrote a program to pass input & output over a TCP socket. The client program opens a connection to the server. The server then sends out messages to the client that is connected. The server and client are connected via a network socket, and the server 'serves' the client messages or executes responses to commands. 
In this barebones model: The server will deliver the message for up to 3 connections and the client will display the received message.
